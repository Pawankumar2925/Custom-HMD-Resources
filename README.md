The paper "A Low-Cost Customizable Head-Mounted Device for the Detection of Ocular Disorders" likely describes the development and testing of a new type of device for detecting ocular disorders. The device is designed to be low-cost and customizable, making it accessible to a wider range of individuals and potentially increasing the detection of ocular disorders. The device is head-mounted, meaning that it is worn on the head, and is used for the detection of ocular disorders, which are diseases or conditions that affect the eyes.
